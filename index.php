		<b><p>Bio</p></b>
		<p align=left>My name is Tarek Aloch.<br><br> My CSS skills leave a lot to be desired but I am
		quickly getting the hang of this! I have previously worked for Logistiq Corporation, a 
		startup based out of central Massachusetts. My work and experience at Logistiq has compelled me
		to build my web development skills. I was recently hired at Bose Corporation.  
		<br><br>
		A major influence of mine is <a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>. He's the founder of Y-Combinator and 
		<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news/">Hacker News</a>. </p> 
		
		<b>Code Editor</b>
		<p>I'm a big fan of Sublime Text 3.</p>
